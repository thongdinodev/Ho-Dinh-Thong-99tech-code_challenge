## Some idea to improve:
* Use rate limit to prevent DOS attack
* I use bcrypt (code in problem 6 folder) to hash password and make login request low, to prevent brute force attack
* store jwt in cookie to prevent XSS attack
## Page demo 
* Page build with NodeJS, ejs template
* Use brcypt to hash password
* Authorization with JWT
* updateScore with protect middleware
* Web page interface
